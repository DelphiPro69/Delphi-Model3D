This is project is to build a three dimentional modeling system
that uses the GLScene project to render, but has an object oriented 
function building system to allow developers to easilly create complex visual objects 
based on complex equations or transformationsm instead of manual design.

This has the potencial to allow users to create their own pieces or 3D objects for 3D printing, which can 
then be easilly scaled or modified through function parameters.
